Cortical thickness
==================

Kevin Cho


This script is for use in Seoul National University Hospital,
     Clinical Cognitive Neuroimaging Center

What it does
------------
* it collects freesurfer based cortical thickness
* into a 'logs' folder in the same directory when run
* you can specify the name of cortical part that you want to save together as one cortex


To someone who wants to use
---------------------------
* lots of editing is probabiliy needed as I used
'$SUBJECT_DIR' as different directory from default
